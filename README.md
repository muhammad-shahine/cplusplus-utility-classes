contains multiple c++  usefull classes.

Big_Int: is my own implementation of the concept dynamically growing number using linked lists pointeres it can be used to compute 
large factorial numbers using multiplication. additiion runs in o(N) time while multiplication is O(N*N) here.
This class manages its own heap memeory.
